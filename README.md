# Useful-Get-AppLockerFileInformation

This is a list of outputs from Get-AppLockerFileInformation to be used for hardening infrastructure against various types of threats.  

This should not be considered comprehensive or up to date.  Applocking publishers blindly can lead to unintended consequences.  Vendors change their publisher name.  When in doubt, verify for yourself.  There are also a variety of ways to bypass applocker, and keep these in mind when you are hardening.

Special thanks to LOLRMM.IO whose repository I found after beginning this project.
